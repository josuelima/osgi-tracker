=== OSGI Tracker

This is a small project built on java using OSGI components.

There are 2 trackable components (animal and bus). The servlet component gets the current
position of each and mounts a map showing the object's location making use of the maps component (uses googlemaps or bing, which are also components).

I used {Apache Felix}[http://felix.apache.org/site/index.html] as server.

This project was developed during a software reuse discipline in my master degree course, just as an exercise to ilustrate how OSGI Components works. Don't take it seriously :)
